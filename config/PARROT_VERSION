# TODO: allow specification of a maximum version, as parrot trunk does
# sometimes break.

# Use this if there is a specific feature in parrot that we need to function.
# partcl trunk will typically use this.

# Or a release number, e.g.:
# release: 1.3.0

# Use this for partcl releases. You'll be more likely to find this in a
# tagged version of partcl, though we may use this in trunk just after
# a release.
