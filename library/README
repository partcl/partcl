The files in this directory (except for this one) come from the tcl
repository at: http://tcl.cvs.sourceforge.net/tcl/tcl/library/

# to get a local copy to compare our checked in versions with, use

make tcl-cvs

in the top level directory.

They are included here under the terms in license.terms

We will probably switch to having the developer check them out,
as soon as we can run tcltest with no modifications.
