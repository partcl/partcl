= Introduction =

{{{make spectest}}} will run all the tcl specification tests that run
to completion.

The files are listed with their basename; for example 'chan' corresponds to
{{{t_tcl/chan.test}}}. If {{{ @SKIP}}} appears after the test name,
that file will not be run during the test.

To avoid regressions, even though a spec test file skips all tests,
it will still be run as long as it runs to completion.

When running tcl tests, you may notice we're more verbose by default than tcl
itself; We're using a slightly modified version of {{{tcltest.tcl}}}
to generate more verbose feedback.

= Progress so far =

  * [http://code.google.com/p/partcl/source/browse/trunk/docs/spectest-current.txt Current test results]
  * [http://code.google.com/p/partcl/source/browse/trunk/docs/spectest-progress.csv Progress of results over time]

= Missing features =

==Flesh out {{{[return]}}} to avoid spurious "bad call to return" errors.==

  * proc
  * result

==smarter {{{[format]}}} ==

{{{[format]}}} is a very thin wrapper around parrot's {{{sprintf}}}; need to
translate some of the tcl idioms in the format string into parrot. {{{[get]}}}
uses format on the failing tests, but they might be numeric conversion issues.

== Need {{{[trace]}}} ==

  * append
  * appendComp

== Need stacktrace support ==

The following test files work, and in some cases pass many tests,
but the remaining failures are attributable to a lack of stacktrace
support when throwing errors.

  * for
  * foreach
  * if
  * incr
  * while-old

== Only a stub/not implemented ==

The implementation that currently exists (if any) is just a stub. Might
also rely on part of the standard library that we haven't yet imported.

  * case
  * config
  * event
  * pid
  * tm
  * unixFile
  * unload

== Mostly Skipped ==

These tests are nearly all skipped. The skips are a result of the test
constraints, which we've done no special work to support. These are not
tests that we've marked skipped in an effort to avoid.

  * assocd
  * cmdInfo
  * dcall
  * dstring
  * history
  * iogt
  * indexObj
  * link
  * lset
  * misc (one PASSED)
  * notify
  * socket
  * stringObj
  * thread
  * winConsole
  * winPipe
  * winTime
  * unixInit
  * unixNotfy
  * winNotify

== Mostly PASSED ==

  * concat
  * for-old
  * if-old
  * join
  * linsert
  * listObj (one SKIPPED)
  * llength
  * lrange
  * lrepeat
  * lreplace
  * pwd
  * security
  * split

= Unexpected errors =

These test files die, either as a result of missing functionality,
a stub returning a wrongly
typed value, or a more developed stub throwing an error when none
is expected, or an issue with the underlying parrot VM.

Because of these failures, *no* PASS from these
file are being counted. (Though in some cases, we might not have any
passes to count.)
